Here you can see how image data are usually represented for machine learning tasks. Complete the code below to load the MNIST data, feel free to add more code (plotting graphs or printing values) to explore the dataset. In the end, since many algorithms work better or can work only with normalized data, use `scale` method in scikit learn to normalize the pixel values."

For instance, a complex prediction model for image captioning works best if the learning dataset is massive and rich.
