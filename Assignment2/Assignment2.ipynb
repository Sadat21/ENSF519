We do this in steps: first we take the list of most popular movies then we gather more informaion on each movie from the movie's page. These info are stored in pandas dataframes. Next we need to combine the information from these two tables, using pandas `merge` method. The resulting merged table might give us some insight on why some movies get more popular. Let's try and see what we can get!\n",
